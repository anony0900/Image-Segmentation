# Image Segmentation using U-Net

This repository contains an implementation of an image segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture. The model is designed to perform pixel-wise segmentation tasks, making it suitable for applications such as medical imaging, object detection, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle. It contains labeled images for segmentation tasks. Please refer to the Kaggle dataset page for more details about the dataset.

## Model Architecture

The U-Net architecture is a convolutional neural network designed for image segmentation tasks. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that help preserve spatial information during upsampling. This architecture is particularly effective for tasks requiring precise localization.

## Key Features

- **U-Net Architecture**: Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections for accurate segmentation.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different datasets and segmentation tasks.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Trained and tested on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anony0900/Image-Segmentation.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training

The model can be trained on the Kaggle dataset by running the training script provided in the repository. Ensure the dataset is downloaded and properly preprocessed before training.

## Results

The model achieves accurate segmentation results on the Kaggle dataset. Example outputs and performance metrics are included in the repository.
